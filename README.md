# chess
I attempt to create chess in python.

There are no checks because checks are for fools who do not realise that their king can be taken. You win by taking the other player's king. 
There are no instructions because I feel that most people know the rules of chess. 
If you do not know the rules of chess, you should first contemplate your life decisions then look up the rules of chess.

chess.py is just basic chess.
chess_2 is a slightly altered version of the game

To run, you need to have pygame zero added.
